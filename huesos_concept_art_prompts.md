# HUESOS — Concept Art Prompts

## Notes on Engine Choice

**Midjourney** is recommended for this project's aesthetic — it handles stylized 3D, painterly lighting, and isometric game art far better than DALL-E. DALL-E tends toward photorealism or cartoonishness, both of which miss the target.

**If using Midjourney:** Append `--ar 16:9` for landscape, `--ar 9:16` for portrait, `--ar 1:1` for square. Add `--s 750` for stronger stylization. Use `--v 6.1` or latest.

**If using DALL-E:** These prompts will work as-is. You may need to regenerate several times to avoid cartoonish outputs. Adding "NOT cartoonish, NOT Pixar, NOT cel-shaded" can help steer it.

**Style anchors to include in most prompts:** "stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, rich warm color palette, isometric game art, similar to Death's Door or The Touryst aesthetic"

## 1. FIDEL — Character Concept

### Full Body (Intact)
```
A skeleton character standing upright with earnest determined posture, simple clean bone geometry, hollow expressive eye sockets, slightly open jaw, no flesh or clothing, just bones. Stylized low-poly 3D render, painterly warm lighting, dark background with scattered marigold petals. Character design concept art, game art style similar to Death's Door. Rich warm palette with deep orange and purple accents against bone white. NOT cartoonish, NOT realistic.
```

### Damage States (Character Sheet)
```
Character design sheet showing the same skeleton character in four states of disrepair: first standing whole and upright, second missing one leg and hopping, third missing both legs and dragging with arms, fourth as just a skull and one arm crawling. Stylized low-poly 3D, clean bone geometry, painterly lighting. Each state shows personality through posture — determination despite damage. Dark background, warm amber lighting. Game concept art.
```

### Fidel with Substitutes
```
A skeleton character with mismatched replacement parts — a bicycle wheel jammed into one hip socket as a leg, a wooden broom handle as the other leg, a jack-o-lantern sitting on the neck as a skull replacement. The skeleton is wobbling forward carrying a single bone in its remaining real hand. Stylized low-poly 3D game art, painterly lighting, cobblestone street at night, marigold petals scattered, warm candlelight glow. Comedic but earnest tone. NOT cartoonish.
```

## 2. MARIGOLD — The Altar Progression

### Empty Altar
```
A small Day of the Dead ofrenda altar in a humble Mexican house, covered in marigold petals, burning candles, papel picado banners, but the center is conspicuously empty — a bare wooden surface where a body should be. Melancholy atmosphere. Stylized low-poly 3D interior, painterly warm lighting from candles, rich oranges and deep purples. Game environment art, isometric perspective.
```

### Altar Mid-Assembly
```
A Day of the Dead ofrenda altar with a partially assembled skeleton lying on it — legs and one arm placed, ribcage present, but skull and other arm missing. The placed arm twitches slightly upward. Candles burning, marigold petals everywhere, papel picado. Emotional, intimate moment. Stylized low-poly 3D, warm candlelight, game environment art. The incompleteness should feel both hopeful and heartbreaking.
```

### Altar Complete — She Opens Her Eyes
```
Two skeletons on a Day of the Dead altar, one complete and lying down with faintly glowing eye sockets just opening, the other sitting beside holding her hand. Surrounded by candles, marigold petals, papel picado. Tender, emotional, quiet. Stylized low-poly 3D with painterly lighting, warm amber and deep purple palette. Game art cinematic moment. Beautiful and melancholy. NOT cartoonish, NOT horror.
```

## 3. THE VILLAGE — Environment Concepts

### Village Overview (Establishing Shot)
```
Isometric view of a small Mexican village during Day of the Dead celebration, cobblestone streets, colonial church with bell tower, market plaza with stalls, tiered rooftops, a river along one edge, farmland in the distance. Papel picado banners strung between buildings, marigold petals covering streets, glowing candles on every surface. Stylized low-poly 3D game environment, painterly lighting, rich saturated warm palette — marigold oranges, deep purples, candlelight yellows against dark shadows. Dense, layered, every building feels purposeful. Game art similar to Death's Door world design.
```

### The Plaza — Daytime
```
Isometric game environment of a Mexican village plaza during Day of the Dead. Market stalls with colorful goods, a stone fountain in the center, papel picado banners overhead, musicians playing, ofrendas on tables. Warm golden daylight, rich colors, stylized low-poly 3D with painterly textures. Bustling but readable — clear paths between obstacles. A tiny skeleton figure visible navigating through the crowd.
```

### The Plaza — Night
```
The same Mexican village plaza at night during Day of the Dead. Hundreds of candles on every surface, papel picado glowing in warm light, fireworks in the sky casting colored shadows. The plaza is alive with dancers and partygoers as silhouettes against candlelight. A lone small skeleton figure picks through the crowd. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, rich contrast between warm candlelight and deep purple shadows. Atmospheric, beautiful, slightly chaotic.
```

### The Alleys
```
Isometric view of narrow cobblestone alleys between old Mexican buildings, tight turns and dead ends, clotheslines overhead, a stray dog at the far end, scattered marigold petals on the ground, warm light spilling from doorways. One path leads to a small gap in a wall — too small for a body but a skull could roll through. Stylized low-poly 3D game environment, painterly lighting, moody warm palette.
```

### The Church & Bell Tower
```
Isometric view of a colonial Mexican church with a tall bell tower, the bell visible at the top glowing with warm light. The tower has climbing routes visible — ladders, scaffolding, ledges. Candles line the church entrance. A small skeleton figure climbs partway up. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, the tower is imposing against a deep purple evening sky. Game environment concept art.
```

### The Cemetery — Evening
```
Isometric view of a Mexican cemetery during Day of the Dead evening vigil. Hundreds of candles on graves, marigold petals covering the ground in orange carpets, mourners as silhouettes, mausoleums creating a mini-maze of paths. Soft ground visible between graves. Warm candlelight against deep blue twilight sky. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly, atmospheric, beautiful and slightly haunting. Game environment art.
```

### The River
```
Isometric view of a river running along the edge of a Mexican village at dusk. Floating candles and marigold petals drifting on the water surface. A skeleton figure floats in the water reaching for a bone that drifts downstream. Cobblestone riverbank, old stone bridge in background. Stylized low-poly 3D game environment, painterly lighting, warm reflections on water. Peaceful but with underlying urgency.
```

## 4. GAMEPLAY MOMENTS

### The Dog Chase
```
A joyful dog running through a Mexican village alley with a bone in its mouth, tail wagging. Behind it, a skeleton missing one leg hobbles in pursuit, one arm reaching forward desperately. Marigold petals scatter in their wake. The dog is happy. The skeleton is determined. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly warm lighting, comedic but earnest tone. Game art action moment, isometric perspective.
```

### The Scatter — Big Hit
```
A skeleton character exploding into individual pieces after being hit by a fireworks rocket in a Mexican village plaza. Bones fly in every direction — skull arcing through the air, arms spinning, legs tumbling across cobblestones. Fireworks sparks and marigold petals in the air. The camera pulls wide to show where everything lands. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, comedic chaos, warm color palette. Game art action moment, slightly elevated perspective.
```

### Skull Rolling Through Drainpipe
```
A low camera angle following a single skull rolling through a stone drainpipe beneath a Mexican village street. The pipe is dimly lit, cobwebs visible, light at the far end. The skull's hollow eyes face forward. The perspective makes the pipe feel large — the world at skull-scale. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, intimate and slightly tense atmosphere. Game art, tight camera perspective.
```

### Hand Spider-Crawling on a Shelf
```
A detached skeletal hand spider-crawling along a wooden shelf in a dark room, reaching toward a lever or switch. Seen from almost ground level — the shelf edge is like a cliff, table legs like columns. A candle nearby casts dramatic shadows. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly warm lighting, tense intimate atmosphere. The hand has personality through its cautious movement. Game art, tight camera.
```

### The Parade
```
A massive Day of the Dead parade filling a Mexican village street — giant mojiganga puppet figures towering over the crowd, marching band, dancers in skull makeup, decorated floats, fireworks overhead. In the foreground, a small skeleton figure tries to cross the street between parade elements. The parade is a wall of beautiful chaos. Isometric perspective, stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, rich saturated colors, game environment art.
```

### Carrying Bones Home
```
A battered skeleton character limping home along a Mexican village street at dusk, carrying two bones carefully in its arms. One leg is replaced with a broom handle, one arm with a pitchfork. It's missing its jaw. Candles line the street. The homestead is visible in the distance with warm light in the window. Determined, tender, slightly comedic. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, warm evening palette. Game art, slightly elevated perspective.
```

## 5. THE GRAVE ROBBERS

### Grave Robber Character Concept
```
Character concept art for a grave robber in a Mexican village — not cartoonishly evil, more opportunistic and weathered. Wearing a worn hat, carrying a bag of bones, slightly nervous expression. Standing near a freshly dug grave at night. Stylized low-poly 3D character design, painterly lighting, dark moody palette with warm candlelight accents. Game character art. NOT cartoonish villain, more morally grey.
```

### The Hideout
```
Isometric interior of a hidden room behind a Mexican village shop — the grave robbers' hideout. Bones displayed on shelves and in crates, maps on the wall with marked grave locations, dim lantern light, a trapdoor in the floor, a small vent in the wall that a skeletal hand could crawl through. Moody, secretive atmosphere. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, dark warm palette. Game environment art.
```

## 6. KEY ART / PROMOTIONAL

### Main Key Art
```
A skeleton standing alone on a cobblestone street in a Mexican village during Day of the Dead, holding a single bone tenderly against its chest. Behind it, the village is alive with celebration — fireworks, candles, dancers, papel picado. The skeleton faces away from the party, looking toward a small house on a hill where warm light glows from the window. One leg is a bicycle wheel. A dog sits nearby wagging its tail. The image captures comedy, tenderness, and determination simultaneously. Stylized low-poly 3D, painterly lighting, rich warm palette, cinematic composition. Game key art.
```

### Title Card Concept
```
The word HUESOS in bold weathered serif font, centered. Below it in smaller italic text: "The Bones of the One You Love." The letters are made of or decorated with bone texture and marigold petals. Background is a dark purple-black with scattered marigold petals falling and a few floating candle flames. Simple, elegant, emotional. Rich warm color palette. Game title card, stylized, NOT cartoonish.
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Regenerate liberally.** AI image generation is inconsistent. Plan to generate 5-10 versions of each prompt and pick the best.

2. **Iterate on winners.** When you get a result close to what you want, use it as a reference for variations. In Midjourney, use the variation buttons. In DALL-E, describe what you liked about the previous result.

3. **Watch for cartoonishness.** Your design profile explicitly rejects cartoonish styles. AI tends to default there for skeleton characters. Keep steering toward "stylized but grounded."

4. **Scale prompts.** Start with establishing shots and character concepts. These set the visual language. Then do gameplay moments and detail shots that match the established look.

5. **These are exploration tools, not final art.** Use AI-generated concepts to communicate vision to collaborators, establish mood boards, and test aesthetic directions. The final game art will be authored by you in 3D.
